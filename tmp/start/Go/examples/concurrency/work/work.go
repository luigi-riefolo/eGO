package main

/*
The purpose of the work package is to show how you can use an unbuffered channel to create a pool
of goroutines that will perform and control the amount of work that gets done concurrently.
This is a better approach than using a buffered channel of some arbitrary static size that acts
as a queue of work and throwing a bunch of goroutines at it.
Unbuffered channels provide a guarantee that data has been exchanged between two goroutines.
This approach of using an unbuffered channel allows the user to know when the pool is performing
the work, and the channel pushes back when it can’t accept any more work because it’s busy.
No work is ever lost or stuck in a queue that has no guarantee it will ever be worked on.
